#Q2. Which month saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?

#this question will need a mutate() to calculate the temperature difference.
#The temperature values are stored as characters after you have run separate() 
#(see the <chr> in the second row if you print the data frame to the console).
#To be able to calculate the difference without an error, 
#you will need to convert them to numeric values with as.numeric() first.
#For rows that are missing a temperature measurement, 
#the temperature difference will be NA.
#How will you deal with these in the rest of the analysis?

?mutate
#as.numeric(Min_temp)
#change char to numeric 
BOM_temp_numeric <- mutate(BOM_filtered, min = as.numeric(Min_temp), 
                      max = as.numeric(Max_temp))

BOM_temp_diff
view(BOM_temp_diff)

#to deal with missing data use NA
BOM_temp_diff <- BOM_separated  %>% 
  mutate(Temp_diff = as.numeric(Max_temp)- as.numeric(Min_temp)) %>% #to mutate to numeric and do maths at same time
  group_by(Month) %>% #group by month
  summarise(Av_daily_temp = mean(Temp_diff, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #calculate mean temp and remove null values 
  arrange(Av_daily_temp) #sort order by specifying column



#Q3 Which state saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?
#to calculate which station is lowest
BOM_station_temp_diff <- BOM_separated  %>% 
  mutate(Temp_diff = as.numeric(Max_temp)- as.numeric(Min_temp)) %>% #to mutate to numeric and do maths at same time
  group_by(Station_number) %>% #group by month
  summarise(Av_daily_temp = mean(Temp_diff, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #calculate mean temp and remove null values 
  arrange(Av_daily_temp) #sort order by specifying column

#now match station_number to state

#tidy BOM_stations

#To tidy it before merging, you will need to gather() the station data into an 
#intermediate form that has three columns, one for the station ID number, 
#one for the type of data being recorded (the info column in the original data), and 
#one for the actual recorded value itself. (Is this intermediate data tidy?)

#This data frame can then be spread() into a shape with one row for each station. 
#Remember that the key argument to spread() identifies the column that will provide 
#the data for the new column names, and the value argument identifies the column that 
#will provide the data for the new cells.

#gather
#gather(tidyr::table4a, key = year, value = TB_cases, -country)
#cows_long <- gather(cows, key = weight_type, value = weight, -id) 
#gather all columns except id

BOM_tidy_stations <- BOM_stations %>% #column names are the station ids in orginal
                      gather(Station_ID, Misc, -info) %>% 
                      #misc is the values, info has the row names
                      spread(info, Misc)


#Finally, you will want to join the two datasets together to identify the state of 
#each weather station. If you run into errors at this step, check that the two data frames
#have a shared column to merge, and that they are the same data type 
#(eg. you canâ€™t merge a character column with a numeric column).
#full_join(df1, df2)

#make sure column names are the same Station_ID/Station_number
#rename(gapminder, country_name = country, population = pop)
#new_name = old_name

BOM_station_rename <- BOM_separated %>% 
                        rename(Station_ID = Station_number) %>% 
                        mutate(Station_ID = as.character(Station_ID)) 
                        #how to change from numeric to character

BOM_merged_data <- full_join(BOM_station_rename,BOM_tidy_stations )

#Which state saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?

BOM_merged_temp_diff <- BOM_merged_data  %>% 
  mutate(Temp_diff = as.numeric(Max_temp)- as.numeric(Min_temp)) %>% #to mutate to numeric and do maths at same time
  group_by(state) %>% #group by month
  summarise(Av_daily_temp = mean(Temp_diff, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #calculate mean temp and remove null values 
  arrange(Av_daily_temp) #sort order by specifying column

#Answer Q3
BOM_merged_temp_diff #QLD av daily temp is 7.36



#Q4, Does the westmost (lowest longitude) or eastmost (highest longitude) weather station
# in our dataset have a higher average solar exposure?

BOM_lon_sol_exp <- BOM_merged_data %>% 
  mutate (Solar_exposure = as.numeric(Solar_exposure)) %>% 
  group_by(lon, state, Station_ID) %>%
  summarise(Av_solar_exp = mean(Solar_exposure, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  #filter(Av_solar_exp > 0) #this removes the null
filter(!is.nan(Av_solar_exp) ) #this removes nan values
  #calculate mean solar exp and remove null values 
  ungroup() %>% #this is needed because n() doesn't work otherwise, can group/ungroup to do multiple averages eg. state then lon
 # slice(-2: - (n()-1)) #this deletes rows 2 to (n= end row) minus 1
  filter(lon == max(lon) |lon == min(lon))
  
#Answer Q4
BOM_lon_sol_exp
#highest av solar average is at eastmost (highest longitude) weather station

#min(lon) =115.8075, av solar exp = 19.2
#max lon = 153.4661 av solar exp = 19.5
