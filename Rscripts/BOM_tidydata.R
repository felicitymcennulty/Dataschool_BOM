#Q1. For each station, how many days have a minimum temperature, 
#a maximum temperature and a rainfall measurement recorded?

#process to in code below:
# filter() the data to keep only rows that have minimum temperature, 
#maximum temperature, and rainfall measurements.
#A group_by() followed by summarise() will then allow you to 
#count the number of rows remaining for each station.

                filter(Min_temp != "-", Max_temp != "-", Rainfall != "-")%>%

                group_by(Station_number) %>%  #see tibble header - there are 20 stations
                summarise(n_days = n()) #count the number of rows remaining for each station

#Answer for Q1 shown in n_days column



#Q2. Which month saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?

#process to follow in code below;
#this question will need a mutate() to calculate the temperature difference.

##--note - now have fixed below chr data issues in BOM_tidy_data dataframe at top of code
#The temperature values are stored as characters after you have run separate() 
#(see the <chr> in the second row if you print the data frame to the console).
#To be able to calculate the difference without an error, 
#you will need to convert them to numeric values with as.numeric() first.
#For rows that are missing a temperature measurement, 
#the temperature difference will be NA.
#How will you deal with these in the rest of the analysis?

?mutate

Q2_BOM <- BOM_tidy_data  %>% 
          mutate(Temp_diff = Max_temp-Min_temp) %>% #calculate difference between min and max
          group_by(Month) %>% #group by month (see - there is 12 groups in tibble)
          summarise(Av_daily_temp = mean(Temp_diff, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #calculate mean temp and remove null values 
          arrange(Av_daily_temp) #sort order by specifying column so lowest is at top of table
#Answer Q2 The month with the lowest average daily temperature difference is month = 6 = June


#for Q3 need to tidy BOM_stations

#To tidy it before merging, you will need to gather() the station data into an 
#intermediate form that has three columns, one for the station ID number, 
#one for the type of data being recorded (the info column in the original data), and 
#one for the actual recorded value itself. (Is this intermediate data tidy?)

#This data frame can then be spread() into a shape with one row for each station. 
#Remember that the key argument to spread() identifies the column that will provide 
#the data for the new column names, and the value argument identifies the column that 
#will provide the data for the new cells.

#gather
#cows_long <- gather(cows, key = weight_type, value = weight, -id) 
#gather - rearranges all columns except ones that you "minus"

BOM_tidy_stations <- BOM_stations %>% #column names are the station ids in orginal
  gather(Station_ID, Misc, -info) %>% 
  #misc is the values, info has the row names
  spread(info, Misc) %>% 
  rename(Station_number = Station_ID) %>%  #change this to match column name in BOM_tidy_data
  mutate(Station_number = as.numeric(Station_number)) #change this to match column type in BOM_tidy_data

#Q3 Which state saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?

#Finally, you will want to join the two datasets together to identify the state of 
#each weather station. If you run into errors at this step, check that the two data frames
#have a shared column to merge, and that they are the same data type 
#(eg. you canâ€™t merge a character column with a numeric column).
#full_join(df1, df2)
#make sure column names are the same Station_ID/Station_number
#rename(gapminder, country_name = country, population = pop)
#new_name = old_name


BOM_merged_tidy <- full_join(BOM_tidy_data,BOM_tidy_stations )

#Which state saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?

BOM_merged_temp_diff <- BOM_merged_tidy  %>% 
  mutate(Temp_diff = (Max_temp)- (Min_temp)) %>% #to mutate to numeric and do maths at same time
  group_by(state) %>% #group by month
  summarise(Av_daily_temp = mean(Temp_diff, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #calculate mean temp and remove null values 
  arrange(Av_daily_temp) #sort order by specifying column

#Answer Q3
#BOM_merged_temp_diff #QLD av daily temp is 7.36


#Q4, Does the westmost (lowest longitude) or eastmost (highest longitude) weather station
# in our dataset have a higher average solar exposure?

BOM_lon_sol_exp <- BOM_merged_tidy %>% 
  group_by(lon, state, Station_number) %>%
  summarise(Av_solar_exp = mean(Solar_exposure, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  #filter(Av_solar_exp > 0) #this removes the null
  filter(!is.nan(Av_solar_exp) ) %>%  #this removes nan values
#calculate mean solar exp and remove null values 
ungroup() %>% #this is needed because n() doesn't work otherwise, can group/ungroup to do multiple averages eg. state then lon
  # slice(-2: - (n()-1)) #this deletes rows 2 to (n= end row) minus 1
  filter(lon == max(lon) |lon == min(lon))

#Answer Q4
#BOM_lon_sol_exp
#highest av solar average is at eastmost (highest longitude) weather station

#min(lon) =115.8075, av solar exp = 19.2
#max lon = 153.4661 av solar exp = 19.5
