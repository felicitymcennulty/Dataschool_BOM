#Which month saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?

#this question will need a mutate() to calculate the temperature difference.
#The temperature values are stored as characters after you have run separate() 
#(see the <chr> in the second row if you print the data frame to the console).
#To be able to calculate the difference without an error, 
#you will need to convert them to numeric values with as.numeric() first.
#For rows that are missing a temperature measurement, 
#the temperature difference will be NA.
#How will you deal with these in the rest of the analysis?

#now match station_number to state

#tidy BOM_stations

#To tidy it before merging, you will need to gather() the station data into an 
#intermediate form that has three columns, one for the station ID number, 
#one for the type of data being recorded (the info column in the original data), and 
#one for the actual recorded value itself. (Is this intermediate data tidy?)

#This data frame can then be spread() into a shape with one row for each station. 
#Remember that the key argument to spread() identifies the column that will provide 
#the data for the new column names, and the value argument identifies the column that 
#will provide the data for the new cells.

#gather
#gather(tidyr::table4a, key = year, value = TB_cases, -country)
#cows_long <- gather(cows, key = weight_type, value = weight, -id) 
#gather all columns except id

BOM_tidy_stations <- BOM_stations %>% 
                      gather(Station_ID, Misc, -info) %>% 
                      spread(info, Misc)


#Finally, you will want to join the two datasets together to identify the state of 
#each weather station. If you run into errors at this step, check that the two data frames
#have a shared column to merge, and that they are the same data type 
#(eg. you canâ€™t merge a character column with a numeric column).
#full_join(df1, df2)

#make sure column names are the same Station_ID/Station_number
#rename(gapminder, country_name = country, population = pop)
#new_name = old_name

                        rename(Station_ID = Station_number) %>% 
                        mutate(Station_ID = as.character(Station_ID)) 
                        #how to change from numeric to character

BOM_merged_data <- full_join(BOM_station_rename,BOM_tidy_stations )

#Which state saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?

BOM_merged_temp_diff <- BOM_merged_data  %>% 
  mutate(Temp_diff = as.numeric(Max_temp)- as.numeric(Min_temp)) %>% #to mutate to numeric and do maths at same time
  group_by(state) %>% #group by month
  summarise(Av_daily_temp = mean(Temp_diff, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #calculate mean temp and remove null values
